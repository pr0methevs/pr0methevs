### ⚡ What Drives Me

> “The beautiful thing about learning is that no one can take it away from you.”  
> — B. B. King

I believe in the power of continuous learning — every project is an opportunity to discover, refine, and grow.
From streamlining deployment pipelines to optimizing backend performance or experimenting with new frameworks, I’m always exploring ways to make systems more intelligent, efficient, and maintainable.

I enjoy collaborating across disciplines — connecting the dots between software engineering, DevOps, and infrastructure to deliver solutions that not only work but scale elegantly.

### 🛠️ Beyond the Keyboard

When I’m not deep in code or debugging CI pipelines, I like to build and experiment in the physical world too.

You’ll often find me:
- Crafting in the workshop through woodworking projects
- Running and maintaining my homelab, testing new self-hosted tools and services
- Diving into AI and automation, exploring how to integrate intelligent workflows into everyday systems
- Tinkering with embedded engineering and hardware integration
- Restoring and maintaining automotive classics

### Always Evolving
I see engineering as an ongoing craft — a combination of problem-solving, creativity, and curiosity.

Whether it’s improving a CI/CD process, architecting a distributed system, fine-tuning a LLM, or learning a new language, I’m constantly pushing to bridge the gap between ideas and implementation.
